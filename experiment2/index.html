			<h1>Experiment 3: Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I took inspiration from M_1_5_02 on the Generative Design website under the Random and Noise subcategory.  And using the example as a starting point for my design, I was able to visualize exactly what needed to be drawn on the canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I only used the output in the Generative Design example as inspiration.  I wrote the code by myself without using any of the examples on the website.  But using some resources online, I was able to create the generative waves that moved from one side to the other.  I did, however, get sidetracked and started to create an ocean with the waves but using this information and knowledge, I was able to get back on track and create something special.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>My code before I started the innovation phase was pretty basic as it was imitating the ocean.  The lines and background color consisted of a gradient which got darker as you went further down the canvas.  Using the code I used to create this gradient effect, I was able to implement it for the shapes underneath the lines in order to create an animated rainbow color effect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and it was something that required a little bit more work than I had thought but still less than my first experiment as I am getting more comfortable with p5.js.  Given my mistake before in the previous experiment, I allowed myself a little more time to complete the project and I believe because of this, the output is more polished.
				</p>
				<p>Creating the animated wave effect in this project turned out to be much easier than I initially anticipated which provided me with a significant boost to my motivation and inspiring me to explore more complex ideas.  Seeing the waves move dynamically across the screen was satisfying and also fueled my creativity.  However, I faced challenges in achieving desired color effects, such as implementing a rainbow fading effect and making the colors translucent to prevent overlap.  Overcoming these obstacles required me to write code in trial and error hoping that something that I changed worked.  Despite the difficulties, Iâ€™m proud of the final outcome as the experience taught me valuable lessons applicable to future projects.
