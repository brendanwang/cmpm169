			<h1>Experiment 2: Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I took inspiration from the Shape Primitives example from the p5.js website.  Since my project was mostly creating an array of images which would later become emojis, it was key to get this step down correctly as it acted as the framework to everything else I added.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The code from the example documented how to create shapes and put them on the canvas.  Since in the early stages of my development, I needed to display shapes as placeholders, I took this code and implemented into my code.  Using the framework from the example on the p5.js website, I was able to successfully print out an array of shapes.  This was perfect for what I needed due to the fact that I was going to place the emojis on these shapes that were in an array in order to get an idea of the positioning of the emojis on the canvas.  Then after I positioned the emojis correctly on the canvas, I no longer needed the shapes so I got rid of them.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Using the code as a platform to branch into another direction, I decided to make the output a little more interesting by adding an animation that would change the background color just from moving the mouse cursor over the canvas.  I thought that by doing this, it would make the output look a lot more interesting and unique since originally I had it where the user would have to press the right arrow key on their keyboard in order to change the color of the background.  I also wanted to add a sine wave animation if the user pressed a specific key but for some reason I couldn't get it to work properly and instead it drew over the artwork and made everything look much worse.  I do believe there could have been more ways to make this unique but given the amount of time I alotted to this project, changing the background color using a mouse hover was the best way.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and it was surely something that required a little more work than I had first expected.  If I knew how much work was required to get specific animations or user inputs to work, I definitely would’ve started the project at an earlier time.  Now that I realize this, I’ll be sure to account the proper amount of time needed to get the project done.  ‘
				</p>
				<p>Some highs of the project was that it was semi-easy to get started.  For example, building out the canvas and creating an array of placeholders which would eventually turn into the emojis was pretty easy.  However, things started to get much more difficult when I got to the innovate phase.  I wasn’t satisfied with the product and wanted to make it stand out more while also satisfying the requirement to add animations.  Originally, I made it so that the user would have to press the right arrow key in order to change the background image.  But I thought that this was pretty boring and uninteresting.  Instead, I decided to make it so that the user would hover the mouse over the canvas to change the color.  And since every pixel you hover over changes the color, every slight movement of the mouse would change the background color.  As a result, you would get a rainbow effect.  All the features I implemented before such as clicking on the mouse to rotate the orientation of the emojis and pressing the ‘s’ key to save the current canvas as a png were pretty easy to implement.  The difficult thing about changing the background color is that each time the background color changed, the entire background would become the foreground, therefore, covering up all the emojis.  In order to fix this, I had to get rid of the randomly generated emoji races and only display a fixed array of emoji races.  As a result of this, I could constantly print out the array of emojis using a loop so it would make it seem like only the background is changing.
