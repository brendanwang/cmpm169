			<h1>Experiment 6: Grammars & Text Art</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with my code from Experiment 4 since that was created using text art and built my project from there.  I also got inspired by an image on google for my experiment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I made it so that the text wouldn't randomly change letters based on the movement in the scene.  I made it so that the text was static so that you can read the hidden message and make the color change from light to dark based on details that the webcam picked up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I added an animation that made the text more bold when the webcam detected movement as well as adding another color mode.  The original color is black and white and the second color is RGB based on what the webcam is reading.  I made it so that you can press left mouse click to change the color mode.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and took about as long as I thought it would take.  Given that I’m finally becoming comfortable with the p5.js library, I feel that I can really start to create something special working off pre-existing examples.
				</p>
				<p>Reflecting on this project, it presented a mix of successes and challenges.  Drawing from my previous experience, particularly Experiment 4, provided a solid foundation making, facilitating a smoother implementation of certain aspects such as webcam integration.  Using my existing knowledge, it enabled a quicker setup and familiarity with the coding environment.  However, there were difficulties in getting the text to show up statically because originally the text would change based on the movement.  I wanted the text to be static so you could still read the hidden message within but make the text darker based on the movement in the webcam.  Another challenge was getting the animation to work.  Although it may seem like the code block in the innovate stage is pretty small, it was a pain because I didn’t know exactly how to implement the animation without using sine and cosine.</p>
