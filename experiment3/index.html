			<h1>Experiment 4: Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with the code that was given as an example during discussion section.  My immediate thought was to create something similar but somehow use the letters in my name to create the image.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I enhanced the artwork's uniqueness by adding animated effects to the video feed. Experimenting with various dynamic techniques, such as morphing, brought motion and vitality to the visuals. These animated effects not only elevated the artwork's aesthetic appeal but also created an engaging and immersive experience for the audience.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I made the artwork more unique by implementing filters that can be cycled through with a simple mouse click. This interactive feature allows viewers to dynamically change the visual effects applied to the video feed, adding an element of personalization and exploration to the experience. By offering a range of filter options that can be easily toggled, the artwork becomes more engaging and adaptable, inviting viewers to interact and discover their preferred aesthetic.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and took about as long as I thought it would take.  Given that I’m finally becoming comfortable with the p5.js library, I feel that I can really start to create something special working off pre-existing examples.
				</p>
				<p>Creating the filters turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. With a clear understanding of how I wanted each filter to manipulate the video feed, implementing them was a smooth process. Leveraging the simplicity and flexibility of JavaScript, I defined each filter as a function within an array, specifying the desired color transformations based on the pixel's RGB values and brightness. This modular approach allowed me to easily add, modify, or remove filters as needed, empowering me to experiment with various visual effects effortlessly. Overall, the simplicity of designing and implementing the filters contributed to the enjoyment and efficiency of the creative process.  However, integrating the video feed at first and creating that bubbly animation wasn’t as smooth as I wanted it to be.  Especially the animation effect, which required changing the parameters in order to alter the speed.
