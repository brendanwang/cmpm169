			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with some examples from the OpenProcessing website but most of my inspiration was from myself.  I was inspired to create a solar system using 3D graphics in p5.js.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I enhanced the scene by adding colors respective to the real life colors of the planets.  I also added stars that would be randomly generated and placed throughout the 3D space to make it seem like the scene was more 3D.  Originally, the background was just black and when the scene was rotated or panned around, it didn't look like the planets were in space.   So as a result, the stars that remain static in the 3D landscape made the scene look 3D.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I made this piece more interesting by adding random explosions that would generate throughout the scene which represented dying stars as well as creating a trail behind each planet to better visualize the orbit around the sun.  I also made the scene canvas much larger to take up the entire screen for maximum immersion.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
