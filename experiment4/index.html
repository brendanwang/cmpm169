			<h1>Experiment 5: 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with some examples from the OpenProcessing website but most of my inspiration was from myself.  I was inspired to create a solar system using 3D graphics in p5.js.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I enhanced the scene by adding colors respective to the real life colors of the planets.  I also added stars that would be randomly generated and placed throughout the 3D space to make it seem like the scene was more 3D.  Originally, the background was just black and when the scene was rotated or panned around, it didn't look like the planets were in space.   So as a result, the stars that remain static in the 3D landscape made the scene look 3D.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I made this piece more interesting by adding random explosions that would generate throughout the scene which represented dying stars as well as creating a trail behind each planet to better visualize the orbit around the sun.  I also made the scene canvas much larger to take up the entire screen for maximum immersion.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and took about as long as I thought it would take.  Given that I’m finally becoming comfortable with the p5.js library, I feel that I can really start to create something special working off pre-existing examples.
				</p>
				<p>Creating this project was both rewarding and challenging.  The process of simulating the solar system, including the planets’ orbits and appearances, was relatively straightforward and provided a sense of accomplishment.  However, implementing randomly generated stars in 3D space proved to be more challenging than anticipated, requiring careful consideration of positioning and rendering.  Additionally, creating trails for each planet presented its own set of difficulties, particularly with Saturn’s rings.  Despite efforts to include Saturn’s rings, I encountered an issue where the trail became offset when drawing them, ultimately leading to leaving them out in the final version.  This setback was disappointing but provided an opportunity to learn and refind my approach to handling complex 3D elements in the future.
