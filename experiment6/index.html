				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I took an example given to us in class and built upon it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I made it so that you could pan and zoom in the scene.  Previously, the globe was constantly spinning which made it really hard to see the data.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I created shooting stars that would randomly spawn in the 3D space.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself and took about as long as I thought it would take.  Given that Iâ€™m finally becoming comfortable with the p5.js library, I feel that I can really start to create something special working off pre-existing examples.
				</p>
				<p>This project had its ups and downs. Since I already had experience making 3D models from a previous project, setting up the space part was pretty easy. Using p5.js for handling 3D stuff made it simple to create a cool-looking space scene without much trouble. But the tricky part was getting the shooting stars to look right. Even though I knew how to use objects and vectors, making sure the shooting stars showed up and moved realistically in the 3D space was tougher than I thought. It took some trial and error to make them move in a straight line while still looking good. Overall, this project taught me not to underestimate the challenges, even in seemingly simple parts of a bigger project, and the importance of patience in problem-solving.
